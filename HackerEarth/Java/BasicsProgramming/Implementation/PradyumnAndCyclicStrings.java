/*
 * Pradyumn found a game named Stringle. In this game, Pradyumn was given a Bit 
 * String. According to game rules, you have to keep rotating the string in 
 * clockwise direction until the string vanishes. Are you wondering, how the 
 * string will vanish if the string will keep rotating.
 * Game shouted "Fellas! There is one more rule, if number of rotations is equal 
 * to current string length. Middle character of the string is deleted. If the 
 * length of current string is even, you are allowed to delete any of (n / 2)th
 * or ( n / 2 + 1)th letter. Rotations counting again starts from 1." Now, 
 * Stringle asks "After how many rotations will the input string vanish". String 
 * follows 1 - based indexing.

 * Constrains:
 * 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
 * 1 ≤ length(BitString) ≤ 10^5

 * Input:
 * One line having one integer T, where T is number of test cases.
 * T lines each having Bit String(String consist of only 0s and 1s).

 * Output:
 * Number of rotations required to vanish the Bit String.
